# Documentation Home

## Purpose
This is the curated documentation layer for the RDS ecosystem. It is optimized for AI analysis and incremental updates.

## Sections
- Project
- Robokit API
- Seer
- Examples
- Scraping
- Decisions

## Conventions
- Each doc is small, single-topic, and has YAML front matter.
- Use status=draft until verified against sources.
- Update catalog.yaml when adding or changing docs.

## Quick Start
1) Read the overview in `docs/project/overview.md`.
2) Check `docs/robokit-api/overview.md` for API scope.
3) Use templates in `templates/` when adding new docs.

## Source Coverage
Raw inputs live in `sources/` and are referenced from each doc.
